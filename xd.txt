[Intro]
Icy money, man, bar season on deck, man, stick boys on deck, man
Thirty two entertainment, I do this shit for the hood, blood in blood out, my clique, my nigga
What's happenin' nigga, East Atlanta we stand out, nigga Zone 6 affiliate, Bouldercrest originated
Get cremated, decapitated, you bitch
Burn one

[Verse]
A hundred bales of kush, you can't even smell me rookie
I got case to vape, I turn coke to cookie
Lookie, lookie, lookie, lookie, here comes Gucci
My bar so sound so I just overdo it
Duece is dab and painted orange on my McClaren
Green color carriage, got the favorite cutie starin'
I'm sprayin' with nobody, I'm signed with nobody
I count my own money, I make my own money
I own my own publishing, check in for a feature
I stack for my mortgage, twelve hundred for my sneakers
Reefer keep her cockin desert eagles for my people
Reefer keep her cockin desert eagles for my people
I got [?] eagles and dubs, corners and people
Them birdies your uncle didn't get
Pound cans of spinach
Flip jugs of X, liters'll let rain
Avalanche of white, a million bales of green
I said g-g-g-g-ive me a brick
Fuck a bitch, all I need is a gun and a clip
I said g-g-g-g-ive me a brick
Fuck a bitch, all I need is the motherfuckin' 6, nigga
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme a brick
I'ma take them down, break them down with my clique
Go in, them re-rock, them bring back
Serve them to the lame ass niggas for the stack
OJ, what's up, what's up, what's up, wait
Gucci, my grill, presses, cuttin'
Slick boy, you know they wouldn't leave
It's the S-O-I-C-Y-A-G, you see?
I-M-A-E-E, he so damn fly
Who is his stylist, the boy be wilin'
He playful on the mic, man the boy so childish
He make it cross over, move just like Ivan
Hook:x2
First you save a couple rubber bands (Yeah!)
Then you bring em back to Gucci Mane (Yeah!)
You know somebody, Shawty you the man (Yeah!)
Imma show you how to stack 100 grand (Yeah!)

Verse 1:
10 years old with a 8-ball jacket
9th grade Mack 9 got a 357
Before I bought my first 50, man I stole a Mack 11
Had to break in partner's house, First mission was successful
Every dollar to my name in my Crease Guess Jeans
Starter jacket, starter shirt, Try to take it, get murked
After school, whatever, yeah, awful lot I'm rollin'
All you gotta do is keep your next door neighbor smokin'
I'm poppin' pills and drinking off, Man I'm losing focus
Salt like a bag boy, cus I stack the groceries
Yeah I make it rain, but I feel like its promotion
Bitches tellin' other bitches 10,000 on Thursday
42 is worthy, Zone 6 is ervy
I could front ya shawty but I feel you don't deserve it

Hook:x2
First you save a couple rubber bands (Yeah!)
Then you bring em back to Gucci Mane (Yeah!)
You know somebody, Shawty you the man (Yeah!)
Imma show you how to stack 100 grand (Yeah!)

Verse 2:
Before it pop, before it dock, Get it hot then make it spin
Splash it with the H2O, Hate to say I told ya so
Two hundred forty-seven thousand, Can I owe you 4?
Long as Gucci owe ya dog, then you're truly never broke
Heavy cus I'm smoking, but I be with hoes that never smoke
Don't won't none in their lungs, but they take some in their throat
My price look like I own the boat, Damn look like I'm on the boat
Like actually I went to South America and bought this coat
Got the money? Where's the dope? Meet me at the Texaco
Backseat of my Chevy, laughing tired, Thought you'd never go
Here's the money, Where's the coke? Meet me at the Amoco
Backseat of my Bentley, Tired of laughing, Thought you'd never go

Hook:x2
First you save a couple rubber bands (Yeah!)
Then you bring em back to Gucci Mane (Yeah!)
You know somebody, Shawty you the man (Yeah!)
Imma show you how to stack 100 grand (Yeah!)

You know, just look at the water

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
The sun ain't even up yet, I'm thinkin' 'bout the check (Wop)
Woke up in the mornin', bust down me a brick
Gave Metro a million, told him not to quit (True)
East Atlanta, Zone 6, Gucci really rich (Rich)
Plus, they keep bud in the kitchen, fuck some eggs and grits
Jimmy Henchman with the shipment, I sold a lot of shit
Heard I killed a man allegedly, but I didn't bust a head (Hah)
The way they mixin' up the medicine, I might just grow some dreads (Uh)

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
It's a bad bitch on the elevator, I'ma let her in
Let your hater be a motivator, I can't let you win
He a genius, human calculator, stack it by the ten
Put the Lambo on the elevator, bring it to the den
Put the Mustang by the balcony, I'm fly like Peter Pan
I'm so glad they turned they back on me 'cause we wasn't really friends (No)
And it ain't even ten and I woke up on a ten (Huh)
And I don't need no pen, no I don't need no pad (Wizop)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
The sun ain't even up yet, I'm thinkin' 'bout the check (Huh)
Woke up in the mornin', bust down me a brick (Skrrt)
Gave Metro a million, told him not to quit (Metro)
East Atlanta, Zone 6, Gucci really rich
Plus, they keep bud in the kitchen, fuck some eggs and grits
Jimmy Henchman with the shipment, I sold a lot of shit
Heard I killed a man allegedly, but I didn't bust a head
The way they mixin' up the medicine, I might just grow some dreads

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Gotta keep them snipers wit' me, dawg
I got more enemies than 50, dawg (Huh?)
He popped a Percocet, he noddin' off (Wow)
On high alert, they just might pop it off (Shh)

It's Gucci Mane, you know it's bricks involved (Skrrt, skrrt)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
The sun ain't even up yet, I'm thinkin' 'bout the check ('Bout it)
Woke up in the mornin', bust down me a brick

Still down to take a brick, out of town for me?
Rippin off the whole clip, thirty rounds for me
See them niggas runnin' up, now lay it down for me
Foreign cars for all solid broads that I know
I drive through and slide all these bum bitches McDonalds
I'm bustin down a pack of that boy-boy in Chicago
You make it to a brick in my hood and you hit the lotto
I hit the lotto like Powerball on a ho
Finna make a money shower fall on a ho
Smokin at the Trump Tower, bout to call a ho
Nigga finna make a money shower fall on a ho

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I'm lookin at her and she's lookin at me
When I walked past the bitch, she probably felt a light breeze
Me and her at the Heat game, check the feet game
And I bet she start cryin' if she ever don't meet
But she'll never, ever, ever find another like me
Stop thinkin' bout yourself, gotta think about the team
Like Hakeem on the Dream, yeah, Olajuwon bitch
Throw a lot of ones bitch, have a lot of fun bitch
Strip, but I love my girl and bodyguard bitch
Your main chick fascinated by my body art trick
10 times out of 10, she's a 10
In the Benz got twins in the Bentley and I wanna fuck her friends
See you baby 'fore I lend it to you baby
I don't call, when I call give it to me baby
In three or four way, I'ma sin for my lady
And if I'm ever in the jail, better send me something baby

[Hook: Gucci Mane & Freddie Gibbs]
Colder than a motherfucker, colder than a motherfucker
10 times out of 10, she's a 10 and I wanna fuck her friends

[Verse 3: E-40]
Ugh, lifestyle ribbit

Thicker than a buttermilk biscuit
Down for the get down, want a real nigga, fuck a clown
When he pound, she don't even make a sound
When I pound, I'ma leave it sore, make her pussy clap like a encore
Ask the people next door, ugh!
She got a gap that's out of hand and this her favorite song
There's something 'bout a broad that like to suck her thumb
She on my shoes like a piece of gum (What she know you not?)
She know I'm not the two, I'm the one (Biatch!)

[Hook: Gucci Mane & Freddie Gibbs]
Colder than a motherfucker, colder than a motherfucker
10 times out of 10, she's a 10 and I wanna fuck her friends

[Intro]
True story
I used to hate Christmas
For real

[Verse 1]
On the first day of Christmas, my true love sent to me
A half of a brick, told me feed my family
I took it to the hood, then I dropped it in the sink (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Then I whipped it into a whole thing
Jumped off the porch early, man it was '93
I had old hoes on my dick when I was 13 (Facts)
On the second day of Christmas, I bought an MC
Supersport and I set it on G’s
Wopped so many niggas had to paint that bitch green
I'm the Grinch that stole Christmas, nigga ask about me
On the third day of Christmas, my old plug sent to me
Ten milk jugs full of pills and like eighty bales of weed
On the fourth day, said, "Fuck that shit," went on a spree
I got niggas still want payback for shit did in '03
It’s vibe, what the fuck you want a fifth and on the sixth
On the seventh day of Christmas, got a new drum for the stick (Wack' em)

[Break]
Shit funny now
Ain't funny then, yeah
Fuck it

[Verse 2]
On the eighth day of Christmas, I got into a beef (I did)
Ninth day of Christmas, they beggin' me for peace (They did)
Tenth day of Christmas, they callin' up police (Chill)
Niggas try to stop it, but they started it with me
Rentals called the house, they gon' terminate the lease (No)
Eleventh day of Christmas, put our shit out on the streets (Fuck)
Twelfth day of Christmas, got my momma losin' sleep
It might be Christmas to you, but just another day to me

[Outro]
I hate Christmas

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
It's a white girl in town: name is "cocaine"
It's some dirty birds in town: Gucci Mane & Waka Flame
We fly in, I’m buyin', say you got more birds? You lyin'
You trying and lying, you boys ain't supplying
I pitch like Nolan Ryan, got cocaina frying
My partners stick up kids, they duct tape rope they gon' tie it
In the bushes they lied in all night, that's my word
By the end of the mornin', they left with them birds
And I'm gone off that purp, and I'm slurring my words
I swerved in my Benz, banged my Forgi's on the curb (Damn!)
The lean, the herb, pay me like the 1st
You cross Brick Squad, get hurt, I got work - Gucci!

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame & Gucci Mane]
My homeboys will get you, pay you on the 33rd (Yeaah!)
2 pints of lean'll have me slurring on my words (Words!)

Stomach full of money, so hundreds I'mma burp ('xcuse me..)
All the hoods love us like the 15th and the 1st (1st)
2 pints of lean'll have me slurring on my words (Words!)
Undertaker car, triple black drop bird (Nyuum)
Stomach full of money, so hundreds I'mma burp ('xcuse me..)

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
Five grand for a head shot
Boy don’t be no Flinstone and get your bedrocked, nigga
Triple red drop, bouncing through the parking lot
Where I'm from, young niggas shooting at the cops (Riverdaleee!)
Where I'm from, they thuggin'
My hood right side, nigga, green flagging
Lay your ass down if you do too much bragging (Hahaha!)
3 K's, 4 Glocks, nigga that's swaggin', uh!
Penalized, then goes the Packer-Man
Rich as hell, you would think I was a cracker, man
I don't know 'em, get ba-ba-back 'em man, fuck 'em then!
Throwin' stacks in club, what that ass do?
Every girl gettin' past you
Send an ambulance on that ass I want that rent due
Robbin every nigga that ain't Hit Squad, Blood or Piru!

My album didn't sell, so I'm layin' niggas down
Shootin' every nigga that burp, sneeze or fucking frown

[Verse 4: YG Hootie]
40 carats on my bracelet, my Polo black
Niggas talking like they want beef, I'm wanting that!
7 grams in this Swisher, I'm gon' solo that
Ridin' 'round with my strap like "where they at?"
All these rap niggas hold us on my Philly hat
You will never be a legend like the Gucci Man
You will never be turnt up like my partner Flock
You niggas hoes, I run your block when them choppers chop

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame & Gucci Mane]

All the hoods love us like the 15th and the 1st (1st)
2 pints of lean'll have me slurring on my words (Words!)
Undertaker car, triple black drop bird (Nyuum)
Stomach full of money, so hundreds I'mma burp ('xcuse me..)
All the hoods love us like the 15th and the 1st (1st)
[Intro]
I'm charging 16 fever, 16 fever, nigga my price cheaper, 16 fever

[Hook]
16 fever coca-ina
X pills, bubble kush, mid-grade reefer
Hoes ride dicks, dog, but I ride Beemers
A square rectangle cost 16 fever

[Verse 1]
16 5-0, there go 5-0
I'm up 2-5 but I need 4 more
I got uncles blowing bundles, mine do numbers while I drive lambo
Off-white yayo, digital scale
Fishscale sending my pigeons by mail
Bring in my drain folks, I just bring me that caine, folks
Gucci got good dope, pills, purp and sizzurp
My workers don't move nothing less than a bizzurd
Gucci got good dope, pills, purp and sizzurp
My workers don't move nothing less than a bizzurd

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Bricks: can't keep em
16 fever, Beemer-speakers, geek-a-meters
Misdemeanors, several subpeonas
See, I'm gonna drink up cause we just linked up
The squad been teamed up, we cutting off fingers
It's 16 fever and that's since april
My Corvette paid for, my old-school paid for
The hummer roll up? That means you assed out
And you didn't cash out, see this my traphouse
I slam fiends backs out, we push white sacks out
See this my traphouse, I slam fiends backs out
We push white sacks out, them backs get pushed out

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm scraping the bowl up, I'm whipping up cake mix
But this ain't red velvet! Don't eat it, you smoke it
Your options are open: you even can snort it!
3 dollar sacks so you know you can score it
Say "you can't afford it". Yo, I can't ignore it
Well go call them dope boys, you know you feel boring!
You know that you fiending, you know that you need it
It's Gucci, I'm greedy. My niggas stay eating
[Hook]
I made somethin' outta nothing, I didn't have nothing to lose
I came up in the struggle, I had holes all in my shoes
Now my price so cheap that people think my connect from Peru
And my dope so fuckin' good, you can put 4 on a 2
So your deuce turned to six,  so an extra four for you
It's so clean, a Junky's dream, she thinks it's 1982
Jesús pull up, I pull up, then we pop trunks and switcharoo
Got that Tec-9 with the coo
And it might knock you out your shoes, Gucci

[Verse 1]
Back to the wall, back to the mall
Wednesday night, I'm back to Kamal's
Bussin' a blunt so I'm breaking the law
Run up on me and I'm breaking ya' jaw
Flippin' the raw, choppin' the car
Put my red bottles  on top of the bar
I'm dropping my top and she dropping her top
Let my roof back and she took off her bra
I raised these niggas like I was they pa'
Give me respect like I'm fuckin' ya' ma'
Brick Squad Records, you know who we are
Check it, respect it or take me to war
Slap you, dare you to take me to court
Take it in blood but I ain't takin' it short
Ain't gettin' paid then what is the point?
If you want mo' then come fuck with ya' boy
Million in cash, in back of the truck
Take your goons, your dick in the dust
Your hitman be whackin' for us
Got headless bodies in back of the bus
I talk big shit but I'm backin' it up
You stakin' and trappin', ain't trappin' for us?
Think you got us well I'll cut off your nuts and I run them through your body in back of the blood

[Hook]
I made somethin' outta nothing, I didn't have nothing to lose
I came up in the struggle, I had holes all in my shoes
Now my price so cheap that people think my connect from Peru
And my dope so fuckin' good, you can put 4 on a 2
So your deuce turned to six,  so an extra four for you
It's so clean, a Junky's dream, she thinks it's 1982
Jesús pull up, I pull up, then we pop trunks and switcharoo
Got that Tec-9 with the coo
And it might knock you out your shoes, Gucci

[Verse 2]
I'm in Sun Valley in a dark alley
Tryna' keep balance in my New Balance
Competitions ain't no challenge, fourteen and I'm so managed
My migo friend but can't speak Spanish
Pressure on but I don't panic
Goin' H.A.M like a ham sandwich
Be calm, I know how to handle it
I vanish in a Vanquish, 50 thousand on these Sam Smith's
Hunnid grand in my pant's, countin' money's romantic
Keep a hunnid, can't handle it, they charge 10 dollars for dances
So I make her dance till' her legs cramp and the bitch said she can't stand me
There's so many fake asses, fuck it, I'mma just smash it
I can't tell if it's fake a or real no more, I think I need glasses
Anti-social, I'mma smoker, so I roll one and don't pass it
Call me Big Unc' when you see me cause I used to give dope to your daddy

[Hook]
I made somethin' outta nothing, I didn't have nothing to lose

Got that Tec-9 with the coo
And it might knock you out your shoes, Gucci

[Hook]
I took one step forward and two steps back
I jumped so many hurdles to get where I'm at
I had one foot out and I had one foot in
And I ain't gonna look back if I get one more chance
And there's one thing that a nigga must understand
That tomorrow's not promised, this is your last day
And I'ma leave my fans with just one line
Try to live your life one day at a time
It's Gucci

[Verse]
[?] Anything
Then why I'm still hurdlin'
My cousin said "You're not a house, Gucci
So why the fuck you got [?]"
I applied for a job once
Really went with the workin'
But soon as I got to workin'
The same niggas start hatin'
I wasn't good at ridin' skateboards
I was better ridin' Daytons
I can't lie, nigga played for it
But it took a lot of patience

[Hook]

EarDrummers
Yah
It's Wizop!
It's Gucci!
Hahh!
Mike Will!
Mike Will Made-It

[Verse]
I'm hearing shooters loading pistols while I'm brushing my teeth (Dang!)
I get so many death threats it's getting normal to me
But I bend, don't break, I don't ask, just take
Black gloves, black tape and I don't play nor pray (Nope!)
Wake up and take a piss, I hear 'em sharpening knives
Main focus every day is make it out here alive (Lawd!)
Take a shower in my boots and go to sleep in my shoes
Last night, I had a dream some killers ran in my room (AH!)
Trying to be patient but nigga I can't wait (Nahh)
Only chance to kill my enemies and beat my case (Yahh)
So when they ask me how I feel about 'em, I can't say
You either with me, or against me or you in my way (Pussy!)
I got a pack of hungry wolves and if I don't feed em
Then they might turn on me, feel like I don't need em
I keep the best pedigree but hell, I don't breed em (Rrrrr!)
It's a lot of people scared of me and I can't blame 'em
They call me crazy so much, I think I'm starting to believe 'em
I did some things to some people that was downright evil
Is it karma coming back to me? So much drama
My own mama turned her back on me and that's my mama (Mama!)
I lost three people close to me in one summer
Ten years later still don't know shot up my Hummer (Hmmm)
But I bend I don't break, I don't ask I take (I take!)
Black gloves and black tape, nigga it's my first day

[Outro]
Wop!
Wop!
Wop!
Wop!
Wop!
Fuck you!
Pussy!
Wop!
Wop!
Wop!
Wop!
Mike Will Made-It
